### Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. It appears in many different areas of mathematics and science.

### Pig Latin
Pig Latin is a language game where words in English are altered. For words that begin with consonants, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word and "ay" is added. For words that begin with vowels, "way" is added at the end of the word.

### Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
